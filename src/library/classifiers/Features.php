 * Manages a dataset's features, providing a standard interface for converting
 * documents to feature vectors, and for accessing feature statistics.
 *
 * Each document in the training set is expected to be fed through an instance
 * of a subclass of this abstract class in order to convert it to a feature
 * vector. Terms are replaced with feature indices (e.g., 'Pythagorean' => 1,
 * 'theorem' => 2, and so on), which are contiguous. The value at a feature
 * index is determined by the subclass; one might weight terms according to how
 * often they occur in the document, while another might use a simple binary
 * representation. The feature index 0 is reserved for an intercept term, which
 * always has a value of one.
